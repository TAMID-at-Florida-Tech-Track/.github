## What is the Tech Consulting Track?
The TAMID at Florida Tech Consulting Track exists to provide students with an
opportunity to get hands-on software engineering experience with organizations
in the Israeli ecosystem.

### How will it work?
We will be working with our client to write code into their existing
database. We will be giving our client weekly updates of our progress, and will
be directly integrated into their project management workflow.

#### Workflow
We will be working in 2-week sprints in coordination with our Project Manager.
Students will [program in pairs](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/pairing/) 
in order to ensure quality code, share knowledge, and bond.

After developing a feature, a code review will then be completed by the Tech Team Lead.

## What is the time commitment?
Unlike regular TAMID Consulting, Fund, or Education, TAMID at Florida Tech Track members 
are expected to contribute roughly 5 hours per week. This is due to the fact that the projects 
are highly technical and require significantly more time and resources than other TAMID projects.

## Engineering Roles

There will be three engineering roles in the Tech Track.

We are looking to have:
1. Technical Project Managers
2. Senior Software Engineers
3. Junior Software Engineers
